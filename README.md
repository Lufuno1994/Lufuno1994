I am an information technology graduate from Tshwane University of Technology. 
I specialized in intelligent industrial systems where I gained robotics and industrial systems skills. 
Not only that, but I went on to acquire online IT certifications on Cisco and Sophos Academy. 
My experience began when I became a network support engineer in the telecommunications industry where network infrastructure and architecture were my focus. 
It continues with Capaciti where I’m being trained to be a junior cloud app developer in salesforce, where I’ve gained skills in lightning experience and schema builder. 
It is not only my tech skills that I improved, but I’ve also learned public speaking and the importance of teamwork.
I find relaxation in reading novels, and this helps me with brain connectivity, increases my vocabulary and memory. 
My life philosophy is that quitting is not an option and that there is always light at the end of the tunnel. 
These words have kept me going and encourage me to do my best to achieve my goals.
